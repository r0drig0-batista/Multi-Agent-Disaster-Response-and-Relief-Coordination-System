# Multi-Agent-Disaster-Response-and-Relief-Coordination-System

This project was developed as part of the Intelligent Systems course and focuses on designing and implementing a multi-agent system (MAS) for disaster response and relief coordination. The system simulates emergency scenarios where different types of agents collaborate to rescue civilians, transport resources, and manage shelters.
